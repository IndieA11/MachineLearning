 Machine Learning Models for Email Spam Detection and Digit Recognition

This project aims to develop and deploy machine learning models to address two distinct yet significant challenges: email spam detection and digit recognition within images. Leveraging the MNIST database and Scikit-Learn library, the project employs a combination of K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Linear Regressor, Logistic Regressor, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Decision Tree Classification algorithms. 

**K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):** Utilized for both email spam detection and digit recognition tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in classification based on similarity metrics.

**Linear Regressor:** Applied for regression analysis, particularly in feature engineering and preprocessing stages to enhance model performance.

**Logistic Regressor:** Employed for binary classification tasks, aiding in distinguishing between authentic and spam emails.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Implemented for digit recognition within images, exploiting spatial hierarchies of features to achieve superior performance.

****Decision Tree Classification: ****Used for both email spam detection and digit recognition tasks, offering interpretability and the ability to handle nonlinear relationships in the data.
